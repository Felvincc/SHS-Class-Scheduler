# class schedule 

idea is

This will automatically create class schedules for any number of classes, classrooms, teachers, subjects.

there will also be conditions you can set for the classes, teachers, subjects, and maybe sometimes rooms
wherein when theres a specific condition of one of the students, such as health conditions, the algorithm will try its best
to make sure the class where the student belongs will not encounter as many stairs or rooms in other floors.

planning to use genetic algorithms for the scheduling algorithm, (inspired by this guy https://github.com/edceliz/GeneticAlgorithmUniversityClassScheduler)

plans for genetic algs:

there will be multiple customizable settings

ex. 
How many breaks per day,
how far each classroom will be from each other,
how early schedule starts,
how late schedule ends, 

possibly sub genetic algorithms for each setting




ignore below:



num_levels

num_subjects 

num_buildings 

num_classrooms 

num_sections 



num_teachers 



important stuff things:

how many levels there are (ex. grade 11, 12) and their respective subjects

teachers that may have conditions (ex. health stuff[same as student thing])

what subjects the teachers teach

Available time the teacher has for teaching (taking into account teachers that also teach from other departments)

subjects that require a specific learning environment

time alloted for these subjects

stories, rooms per story, building name of buildings

classroom environments (ex. has_tv, comp_lab, chem_lab), and where they are located

class sections and any notable conditions of students (ex. health problems that prohibit them from climbing many flights of stairs)
