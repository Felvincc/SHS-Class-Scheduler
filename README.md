class schedule thing

this program uses a constrained random algorithm, with principles of greedy algorithm.

How it works:

    The program takes the user input, and compiles it into data the program can read.

    The data is then put through the constrained randomizer.

    Then the output is interpreted into a form that can be read by people

GUI Plans:

    Enter how many levels there are

        Enter name of level _

            How  many sections are in this levl

                how many subjects are in level _? (Interchangeable subjects will count as one. ex: PE/CFFS)

                    for y in how many subjects:

                        enter name of subject {y+1}: 

    How many buildings are there

        What is the name of building _?

            how many floors are in building _?

                How many rooms are there in each floor? (include unusable rooms)

                    Are there any unusable rooms in building _? (Faculty, Guidance office, rooms that do not exist, etc.)

                        (gui with a add unusuable room button. Drop down menu of the floors, and drop down menu of the rooms, select the floor and room number of the unusable room)
